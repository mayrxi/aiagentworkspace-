# Figma Wireframe Structure

Frames to create in Figma:

1. Onboarding / Home
- Hero with CTA "Create your first AI Workspace"
- Short explanation and 3 sample agent cards

2. Dashboard View
- Left Sidebar: Agent list with status badges
- Main Panel: Collaboration Feed (agent messages), Task Status columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Top Bar: Add Agent, Add Task buttons, user profile

3. Create Agent Modal
- Fields: Agent Name, Role Type (dropdown), Goal / Prompt box, Persona / Tone, Create button

4. Task Assignment View
- Select Agent dropdown, Task description, Priority, Due Date, Assign button

5. Progress Dashboard
- Cards: % Completed, Avg Agent Accuracy (simulated), Time Saved (estimate)
- Table: Recent Workflows with status and actions

Design notes:
- Use modular "Agent Card" components.
- Keep onboarding simple with pre-built demo agents.
- Show agent logs with a "reasoning" toggle for transparency.
